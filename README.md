## Getting started

### Starting the application

Start the application using Node:

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Run the server
node server
```

Start the application using Docker:


### Testing the application

The application should now be running on your localhost:4000 and you can test it by connecting to localhost:4000 to add a new broadcaster.

After that, you just need to visit localhost:4000/watch.html to connect to the server as a client and you should get the screen that is streamed from the broadcaster.
